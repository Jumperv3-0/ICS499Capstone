This is where we log changes made so we all know what has been done and what we are working on.

9/1:
Created a quick mockup of our home page. It still needs some work with possible color scheme and text sizes
as well as layout. Would like your input on what you like/dont like or want to change.

10/2:
Replaced header with function that calls a logged in or a logged out header depending on if the user is logged in or not. Tested but has not been tested with working cookies.
Added constructors for User, Item, and GarageSales. Have not tested.

10/7:
Added database file, it still needs data
